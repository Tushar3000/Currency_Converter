# Currency_Converter
A simple Java-based application that converts amounts between four major currencies â€” Indian Rupee (INR), British Pound (GBP), United States Dollar (USD), and Euro (EUR). The program takes an amount in one currency, applies up-to-date or predefined exchange rates, and displays the equivalent value in the target currency.
